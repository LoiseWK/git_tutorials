This is my first README file
# BMI Calculator
In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurements:
1.Weight(Kgs)
2.Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is  overweight, normal or underweight.

This is  the last edit.

# we have cretaed a branch called new features
